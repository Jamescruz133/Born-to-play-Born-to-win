        <h2>Basketball</h2>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams of five aim to score by shooting a ball through a 10-foot-high hoop. Players move the ball by dribbling or passing and score with field goals (worth two or three points) or free throws (one point). The team with the most points wins. Itâ€™s a fast-paced game requiring agility, teamwork, and precision.</p>
        
        <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
        <p>In basketball, two teams of five players each try to score by shooting a ball into the opposing team's hoop. Players move the ball by dribbling or passing, and a team has 24 seconds to attempt a shot. Field goals are worth two or three points, and free throws are worth one. Physical contact is limited, and fouls lead to free throws or loss of possession. The team with the most points at the end wins.</p>
        
        <h3>Tips</h3>
        <p>To excel in basketball, master dribbling and shooting form, stay low on defense, improve court vision, use fakes, rebound aggressively, build stamina, communicate well, be smart with fouls, and practice consistently.</p>
        
        <h3>Accessories</h3>
        <p>Basketball accessories like shoes, headbands, wristbands, knee and elbow pads, compression sleeves, mouthguards, ankle braces, finger tape, and sports goggles enhance player safety, comfort, and performance on the court.</p>
